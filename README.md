https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java

In eclipse, select Window>Show View> Other > Git > Git Repositories

Select "Clone a Git Repository" In the URI field, fill in our repo url: https://github.com/Polop23/LandsharksByTheSea

Click Next, Next again Make a note of the Directory that the repo is copied to.

By default it's /Users/yourname/git/LandsharksByTheSea. I recommend leaving it as is.

Now click finish. Now close Eclipse, reopen and set your workspace to the directory in step 6(Users/yourname/git/LandsharksByTheSea) 

Now select File>New>Project>WPILib Robot Java Development > Robot Java Project Enter 8621 for the team number 

For project name, put in LandsharksByTheSea. This is VERY IMPORTANT not to change the name, and capitalization matters, so just copy/paste this: LandsharksByTheSea 

Select "Command-Based Robot" and click Finish. 

Now you're ready to start programming!!!
